# ideas

- interactive website with WebGL or Unity for placing lightbulbs in a room and simulating lighting and mood

- separation rendering/displaying
- --> baking of textures 
- --> server side rendering (with user input on client side)
- --> rudimentary live view on client side for placement of light sources and objects
- --> blender script api for rendering (maybe in combination with REST API/ server)
- --> Unity as backend rendering tool or frontend designing app? (WebGl app export possible)
- --> lighting models to be implemented?

# tasks until next time

- research on applicable technologies and approaches (until next week calendar week 14)
- power point for project idea
